With solving this problems, I practice working php basic sintax.

## Problem: DrawAnSWithButtons
Write a PHP script that draws 5 x 9 <button> elements with 0 and 1 in them. The 1s should form a figure “S”. Make the 1s’ background color – blue. There is no indentation on the elements.
### Example :
![Example S](https://github.com/DimitrovVladimir/PHP-basic/blob/master/Example%20SHTML.png)
## Problem: HTMLButtons
You are given a number num. Write a PHP script that generates HTML <button> elements. The buttons must hold a number from 1 to num as their caption. The input comes as a parameter named num, holding a positive integer.
There is no indentation on the elements.
### Example:
#### input:
3
### Output:
![Example 3](https://github.com/DimitrovVladimir/PHP-basic/blob/master/Example%20HTML%20buttons.png)

## Problem: Product of 3 Numbers

You are given a number num1, num2 and num3.

 Write a PHP script that finds if num1 * num2 * num3 (the product) is negative or positive.
 
 Try to do this WITHOUT multiplying the 3 numbers.
The input comes as parameters named num1, num2 and num3.

### Example:
#### input:
2

3

-1

#### output:
Negative
